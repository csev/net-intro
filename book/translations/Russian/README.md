Dear Charles,

Our Russian publishing house DMK Press is interested in your book:

Introduction to Networking

And what about the license terms (paper and electronic copies)?

Best Regards,

Movchan,

I am open to a Russian translation of the book.   My typical arrangements
for a translated book are that I give you a non-exclusive right to selli
print copies of your book and ask for no royalties for me - but I get a
freely redistributable electronic copy of the translation.  You can still
sell the electronic copy and I will point to your book on my web
site - I just want to be able to have a free electronic copy of the book.

/Chuck
